C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

    -> is a better C
    -> supports data abstraction
    -> supports object-oriented programming
    -> supports generic programming.


Applications of C++:
    * 12D Solutions: Computer Aided Design system for surveying, civil engineering, and more.
    * Adobe Systems: All major applications are developed in C++:
        ->  Photoshop & ImageReady,
        ->  Illustrator,
        ->  Acrobat,
        ->  InDesign,
        ->  GoLive,
        ->  Frame (mostly C, some C++)
    * Maya: Maya has been used in the production of just about every major film involving computer-generated effects since its release, including Star Wars Episode I, Spider-Man, Lord of the Rings, Stuart Little, etc.
    * Amazon: Software for large-scale e-commerce.
    * Apple: OS X is written in a mix of language, but a few important parts are written in C++. The two most interesting are
        ->  Finder
        ->  IOKit device drivers. (IOKit is the only place where we use C++ in the kernel, though.)
    * Amdocs: It's main telecom billing module (Enabler) is completely in C++. They are world no.1 BSS vendor for telecom.
    * Autodesk: A large number of major number of application in the CAD domain.
    * D E Shaw: Financial analysis and trading software.
    * Dassault Systems: Catia v5; leading CAD software, on which was conceived all recent Airbus planes (A380, ...). Also, Boeing 787 software. Entirely written in C++, using STL.
    * Facebook: Several high-performance and high-reliability components.
    * Google: web search engine, etc.
        -> Chromium browser.
        -> Google file system.
        -> MapReduce large cluster data processing.


Tokens: Smallest element of a program that a compiler can understand
    -> Keywords
    -> Identifiers
    -> Constants
    -> Strings
    -> Special Symbols
    -> Operators


Identifiers: Identifiers refer to the name of variables, classes, structures, functions, arrays given by the programmer


Rules of declaring an Identifier:
    -> First character must be an alphabet (or underscore)
    -> Must consist of only letters, digits or underscore
    -> Cannot use a Keyword
    -> Must not contain whitespace
    -> They are case sensitive


Keywords: Keywords have fixed meaning and these meanings cannot be changed.


Constants: Constants refer to fixed values that do not change during execution of the program.
    Eg: const int x = 20;


Special Symbols
    * [] {} () , # ~ . ;


Operators
    * Unary Operator
    * Binary Operator
    * Ternary Operator


String: Strings are nothing but array of characters.
    char x[15] = "vishnukumar650"
    char x[] = "vishnukumar650"
    char x[] = {'v','i','s','h','n','u'}


Declaration vs Definition
    int x; // declaring a variable
    int x = 20 // declaring a variable and initializing it
    extern int x // declaring 
    int fun(); // function definition
